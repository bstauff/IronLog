# IronLog
After having spent a bunch of time in the Xamarin.Forms and Xamarin Native world, I wanted to get my feet wet in native iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI.

To that end, I am building Ironlog!  Ironlog is a simple workout tracker app that is compatible with the biggest non-linear periodizaiton based strength and conditioning program.

Hopefully, it'll be a useful tool for anyone running this strength training program!
